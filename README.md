## Gnome Shell Screenshot DBus Emulation

Fork of https://gitlab.com/jamedjo/gnome-dbus-emulation-wlr, that is inspired by https://gitlab.com/jamedjo/gnome-dbus-emulation-wlr but rewritten in Go so it can be compiled to a binary and used in my .files easily. Also it only has support for `grim` and hard-coded `DP-1` output.

Check this to fix problems with Zoom: https://gitlab.com/jamedjo/gnome-dbus-emulation-wlr/-/issues/1
